# My Cypress Automation

This project uses Cypress to automate the testing of a feature to change a user's information within the platform, and a feature that guarantees a no user found message, when searching within the platform, for an unregistered user.
Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows developers to write tests and run them in a real browser.

```
> **NOTE:**
>
> it is necessary to have **node** installed
